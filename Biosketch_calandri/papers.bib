               in adults with no prior history of cognitive impairment.
               METHODS: Searches in Medline/Web of Science/Embase from January
               1, 2020, to December 13, 2021, were performed following
               Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and

               Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score comparing
               recovered COVID-19 and healthy controls was performed. RESULTS:
               Oof 6202 MANUALs, 27 studies with 2049 individuals were
               included (mean age = 56.05 years, evaluation time ranged from
               the acute phase to 7 months post-infection). Impairment in
               executive functions, attention, and memory were found in
               post-COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis was performed with a
               subgroup of 290 individuals and showed a difference in MoCA
               score between post-COVID-19 patients versus controls (mean
               difference = -0.94, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -1.59, -0.29;
               P = .0049). DISCUSSION: Patients recovered from COVID-19 have
               lower general cognition compared to healthy controls up to 7
               months post-infection.",

               Intervention to Prevent Cognitive Decline (LatAm-FINGERS) is the
               first non-pharmacological multicenter randomized clinical trial
               (RCT) to prevent cognitive impairment in Latin America (LA). Our
               aim is to present the study design and discuss the strategies
               used for multicultural harmonization. METHODS: This 1-year RCT
               (working on a 1-year extension) investigates the feasibility of
               a multi-domain lifestyle intervention in LA and the efficacy of
               the intervention, primarily on cognitive function. An external
               harmonization process was carried out to follow the FINGER
               model, and an internal harmonization was performed to ensure
               this study was feasible and comparable across the 12
               participating LA countries. RESULTS: Currently, 1549
               participants have been screened, and 815 randomized.
               Participants are ethnically diverse (56\% are Nestizo) and have
               high cardiovascular risk (39\% have metabolic syndrome).

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy is a rare syndrome
               characterised by early, prominent, and progressive impairment in
               visuoperceptual and visuospatial processing. The disorder has
               been associated with underlying neuropathological features of
               Alzheimer's disease, but large-scale biomarker and
               neuropathological studies are scarce. We aimed to describe
               demographic, clinical, biomarker, and neuropathological
               correlates of posterior cortical atrophy in a large
               international cohort. METHODS: We searched PubMed between
               database inception and Aug 1, 2021, for all published research
               studies on posterior cortical atrophy and related terms. We
               identified research centres from these studies and requested
               deidentified, individual participant data (published and
               unpublished) that had been obtained at the first diagnostic
               visit from the corresponding authors of the studies or heads of
               the research centres. Inclusion criteria were a clinical
               diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy as defined by the local
               centre and availability of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (PET
               or CSF), or a diagnosis made at autopsy. Not all individuals
               with posterior cortical atrophy fulfilled consensus criteria,
               being diagnosed using centre-specific procedures or before
               development of consensus criteria. We obtained demographic,
               clinical, biofluid, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data.
               Mean values for continuous variables were combined using the
               inverse variance meta-analysis method; only research centres
               with more than one participant for a variable were included.
               Pooled proportions were calculated for binary variables using a
               restricted maximum likelihood model. Heterogeneity was
               quantified using I2. FINDINGS: We identified 55 research centres
               from 1353 papers, with 29 centres responding to our request. An
               additional seven centres were recruited by advertising via the
               Alzheimer's Association. We obtained data for 1092 individuals
               who were evaluated at 36 research centres in 16 countries, the
               other sites having not responded to our initial invitation to
               participate to the study. Mean age at symptom onset was 59·4
               years (95\% CI 58·9-59·8; I2=77\%), 60\% (56-64; I2=35\%) were
               women, and 80\% (72-89; I2=98\%) presented with posterior
               cortical atrophy pure syndrome. Amyloid $\beta$ in CSF (536
               participants from 28 centres) was positive in 81\% (95\% CI
               75-87; I2=78\%), whereas phosphorylated tau in CSF (503
               participants from 29 centres) was positive in 65\% (56-75;
               I2=87\%). Amyloid-PET (299 participants from 24 centres) was
               positive in 94\% (95\% CI 90-97; I2=15\%), whereas tau-PET (170
               participants from 13 centres) was positive in 97\% (93-100;
               I2=12\%). At autopsy (145 participants from 13 centres), the
               most frequent neuropathological diagnosis was Alzheimer's
               disease (94\%, 95\% CI 90-97; I2=0\%), with common
               co-pathologies of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (71\%, 54-88;
               I2=89\%), Lewy body disease (44\%, 25-62; I2=77\%), and
               cerebrovascular injury (42\%, 24-60; I2=88\%). INTERPRETATION:
               These data indicate that posterior cortical atrophy typically
               presents as a pure, young-onset dementia syndrome that is highly
               specific for underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. Further
               work is needed to understand what drives cognitive vulnerability
               and progression rates by investigating the contribution of sex,
               genetics, premorbid cognitive strengths and weaknesses, and
               brain network integrity. FUNDING: None.",

               autoimmune disorders. Over the years, it has become clear that
               melatonin may exacerbate some autoimmune conditions, whereas it
               alleviates others such as multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis
               is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a dysregulated immune
               response directed against the central nervous system. Indeed,
               the balance between pathogenic CD4+ T cells secreting
               IFN‐$\gamma$ (TH1) or IL‐17 (TH17); and FoxP3+ regulatory T
               cells and IL‐10+ type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells) is
               thought to play an important role in disease activity. Recent
               evidence suggests that melatonin ameliorates multiple sclerosis
               by controlling the balance between effector and regulatory
               cells, suggesting that melatonin‐triggered signaling pathways
               are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we

               diagnostics, and care. METHODS: In 2023, the Alzheimer's
               Association hosted its eighth satellite symposium in Mexico,
               highlighting emerging dementia research, priorities, and
               challenges within LatAm. RESULTS: Significant initiatives in the
               region, including intracountry support, showcased their efforts
               in fostering national and international collaborations; genetic
               studies unveiled the unique genetic admixture in LatAm;
               researchers conducting emerging clinical trials discussed
               ongoing culturally specific interventions; and the urgent need
               to harmonize practices and studies, improve diagnosis and care,
               and use affordable biomarkers in the region was highlighted.
               DISCUSSION: The myriad of topics discussed at the 2023 AAIC

               aimed to enhance diagnostic precision by developing the SPAMS
               (SuS, PACNS, MS) score, a practical radiological tool. METHODS:
               This multicenter study included 99 patients (43 SuS, 37 MS, 19
               PACNS) from South American countries. Relevant MRI features were
               identified through an elastic-net model determined key
               variables. RESULTS: The SPAMS score assigned 2 points for
               snowball lesions, 1 point for spokes-like lesions, or if there
               are more than 4 lesions in the corpus callosum, corpus callosum

               gadolinium-enhancing lesions or 4 points if Dawson's fingers are
               present. Bootstrapping validated the optimal cutoff at 2 points,
               exhibiting a diagnostic performance of area under the curve =
               0.931, sensitivity = 88\%, specificity = 89\%, positive
               predictive value = 88\%, negative predictive value = 89\%, and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Approximately 40\% of dementia cases worldwide are
               attributable to 12 potentially modifiable risk factors. However,
               the proportion attributable to these risks in Latin America
               remains unknown. We aimed to determine the population
               attributable fraction (PAF) of 12 modifiable risk factors for
               dementia in seven countries in Latin America. METHODS: We used
               data from seven cross-sectional, nationally representative
               surveys with measurements of 12 modifiable risk factors for
               dementia (less education, hearing loss, hypertension, obesity,
               smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity,
               diabetes, excessive alcohol intake, air pollution, and traumatic
               brain injury) done in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile,
               Honduras, Mexico, and Peru. Data were collected between 2015 and
               2021. Sample sizes ranged from 5995 to 107 907 participants
               (aged $\geq$18 years). We calculated risk factor prevalence and
               communalities in each country and used relative risks from
               previous meta-analyses to derive weighted PAFs. Pooled PAFs for
               Latin America were obtained using random effect meta-analyses.
               FINDINGS: The overall proportion of dementia cases attributed to
               12 modifiable risk factors varied across Latin American
               countries: weighted PAF 61·8\% (95\% CI 37·9-79·5) in Chile,
               59·6\% (35·8-77·3) in Argentina, 55·8\% (35·7-71·5) in Mexico,
               55·5\% (35·9-70·4) in Bolivia, 53·6\% (33·0-69·3) in Honduras,
               48·2\% (28·1-63·9) in Brazil, and 44·9\% (25·8-61·2) in Peru.
               The overall PAF for dementia was 54·0\% (48·8-59·6) for Latin
               America. The highest weighted PAFs in Latin American countries
               overall were for obesity (7\%), physical inactivity (6\%), and
               depression (5\%). INTERPRETATION: The estimated PAFs for Latin
               American countries were higher than previous global estimates.
               Obesity, physical inactivity, and depression were the main risk
               factors for dementia across seven Latin American countries.
               These findings have implications for public health and
               individually targeted dementia prevention strategies in Latin
               America. Although these results provide new information about
               Latin American countries, demographics and representativeness

               crimes of sale and/or possession of narcotics. A control group

               access to services for patients who are confined, have limited
               personal access to healthcare, or live in remote areas. The
               emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased
               the use of teleNP for cognitive assessments. The main objective

               potentially best adapted to the practice of teleNP in Latin
               America, and thereby facilitate professional decision-making in
               the region. METHOD: Steps taken to develop these recommendations
               included (1) formation of an international working group with
               representatives from 12 Latin American countries; (2) assessment
               of rationale, scope, and objectives; (3) formulation of clinical
               questions; (4) evidence search and selection; (5) evaluation of
               existing evidence and summary; and (6) formulation of
               recommendations. Levels of evidence were graded following the
               Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system. Databases

               3D-FLAIR. Patients were scanned in a 3T MRI scanner (GE Medical
               Systems, discovery-MR750), applying a comprehensive protocol
               including post-contrast 3D-FLAIR and SWAN-venule sequences. CVS
               presence was confirmed by two trained raters. RESULTS: Thirty
               MRIs of subjects with MS were analyzed. One hundred and one
               infratentorial lesions were detected on FLAIR, and 86\% were
               centered by a vein. Fifteen MRIs from the non-MS group were
               analyzed, 19 lesions were visible ion FLAIR and 16\% were
               positive for the CVS. CONCLUSIONS: SWAN-venule detects
               infratentorial lesions and highlights the central vein in MS
               plaques at 3T MRI. As occurs in the supratentorial brain, most
               infratentorial lesions are perivenular.",

               that dementia patients infected with SARS-CoV-2experience more
               pronounced deterioration compared to those who are uninfected.
               Methods: Research from 01/03/2020 to 07/10/2023 was conducted
               using Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases, and
               adhering to PRISMA guidelines and the PICO framework. The study
               aimed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with
               worse outcomes in dementia patients. The protocol is registered
               in PROSPERO (CRD42022352481), and bias was evaluated using the
               Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Among 198 studies reviewed,
               only three met the criteria. Chen et al. (2023) identified
               higher mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected dementia patients, while
               Merla et al. (2023) observed faster cognitive decline in
               infected individuals with increased hospital admissions.
               Additionally, Cascini et al. (2022) reported an increased risk

               patients, highlighting comorbidities and antipsychotic
               medication use as key risk factors. Conclusion: These limited
               data suggest higher mortality and cognitive decline in dementia

  abstract  = "Measures of social cognition have now become central in
               neuropsychology, being essential for early and differential
               diagnoses, follow-up, and rehabilitation in a wide range of
               conditions. With the scientific world becoming increasingly
               interconnected, international neuropsychological and medical
               collaborations are burgeoning to tackle the global challenges
               that are mental health conditions. These initiatives commonly
               merge data across a diversity of populations and countries,
               while ignoring their specificity. OBJECTIVE: In this context, we
               aimed to estimate the influence of participants' nationality on
               social cognition evaluation. This issue is of particular
               importance as most cognitive tasks are developed in highly
               specific contexts, not representative of that encountered by the
               world's population. METHOD: Through a large international study
               across 18 sites, neuropsychologists assessed core aspects of
               social cognition in 587 participants from 12 countries using
               traditional and widely used tasks. RESULTS: Age, gender, and
               education were found to impact measures of mentalizing and
               emotion recognition. After controlling for these factors,
               differences between countries accounted for more than 20\% of
               the variance on both measures. Importantly, it was possible to
               isolate participants' nationality from potential translation
               issues, which classically constitute a major limitation.
               CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings highlight the need for
               important methodological shifts to better represent social
               cognition in both fundamental research and clinical practice,
               especially within emerging international networks and consortia.

               for many medical specialties. Surgical approaches to the orbit
               present significant difficulties for the general neurosurgeon.
               Whoever decides to practice orbital surgery must have vast
               anatomical knowledge of this structure. However, although many
               of the existing publications about orbital anatomy show the
               complexity of this structure in detail, they fail to facilitate
               their understanding. The purpose of this study was to
               systematise and simplify the anatomical study of the orbit from
               a surgical perspective, to facilitate its understanding.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the international literature
               on the subject was carried out, and the principle of the rule of
               7was followed for its ordering. For illustration purposes,
               photographs of cadaveric preparations and digital drawings were
               used. RESULTS: The orbits are 2cavities located symmetrically on
               both sides of the nose. They have a pyramidal shape, with
               4sides, a posterior vertex, an anterior base and their axis
               established from the sagittal plane at a 20-degree angle. A
               distinctive feature of the orbit is that its elements are
               organised into groups of seven: 7bones, 7intraorbital
               extraocular muscles and 7nerves. CONCLUSION: A systematisation
               of the orbital anatomy was performed with clear illustrations to
               simplify its study. The understanding of the anatomy of the
               orbit is vital to classify lesions and provides a solid basis
               when choosing the most appropriate approach for their treatment.",

               semi-structured questionnaires were applied via telephone to
               family caregivers of people diagnosed with dementia in three
               cities in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, in order to assess
               clinical and behavioral changes in people with dementia and in
               their caregivers. RESULTS: In general, 321 interviews were
               conducted. A significant decline in memory function has been
               reported among 53.0\%of people with dementia. In addition,
               31.2\%of individuals with dementia felt sadder and 37.4\%had

               However, there is a group of aged individuals who have
               exceptional memory performance: the superagers. OBJECTIVE: Our
               aim was to identify the environmental factors that could
               influence exceptional memory performance in a cohort of
               Argentine individuals. METHODS: Forty healthy volunteers >80
               years of age were classified into two groups, superagers (SA,
               n=20) and normal agers (NA, n=20), according to the Northwestern
               SuperAging Program criteria. Participants were
               neuropsychologically tested and evaluated on environmental
               aspects: working status, education, bilingualism, cognitive
               reserve, physical activity, social networking, clinical
               comorbidities, and longevity of parents and siblings. RESULTS:
               Both groups were highly educated (NA=16.3$\pm$3 years; SA
               15.85$\pm$2.6; p=0.6), 11.8\% of the sample was still working
               without differences between groups. There were no differences in
               cognitive reserve inventory (p=0.7), physical activity
               engagement (p=0.423), or social network index (p=0.73). As for
               longevity, 44\% of the siblings lived longer than 80 years of
               age (p=0.432) and maternal longevity was linked to SA
               (NA=46.7\%; SA=80\%; p=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: This study is a
               pilot approximation to the superaging population in Argentina.
               Our results suggest that environmental factors related to
               successful aging do not differentiate superaging. SA may depend

               that assesses verbal and non-verbal memory and has proven useful
               in staging memory decline in amnestic disorders and primary
               progressive aphasia. Given its simple structure, the 3W3S can be
               easily adapted to other languages maintaining the original
               shapes and only modifying the words. We aim to validate a
               Spanish version of the 3W3S test and establish whether memory
               loss patterns present in amnesic disorders associated with
               Alzheimer's etiology and PPA were correctly characterized.
               METHOD: The translation and adaptation of the 3W3S were
               performed according to standardized guidelines and applied to a
               cohort of patients with Dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT = 20),

              risk during diverse approaches to the craniovertebral junction.
              Our objective is to present a system of anatomic and topographic
              landmarks to identify the V3-VA during the paramedian
              suboccipital approach (PMSOA) with the help of minimal or basic
              tools. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The first was a retrospective
              analysis of the angiotomography (CTA) of 50 patients over
              18-years old, and 9 anatomical dissections. A series of lines
              were defined between the different bony landmarks. Within this
              lines the risk area of the vertebral artery (RAsV3-VA) and the
              risk point of the vertebral artery (RPsV3-VA) were defined. The
              second stage was a prospective study, where the previously
              defined measurements were carried out by using neuronavigation in
              10 patients (20 sides) operated with the PMSO approach in order
              to confirm the presence of the V3 segment in the RAsV3-VA and
              RPsV3-VA. RESULTS: In the first stage, the V3 segment was found
              in the middle third of the X line in 96,6\% of the cases. The
              distance between the inion and the UCP (percentile 5) was 20 mm
              and to the LCP (percentile 95) was 40 mm. In the range between
              the UCP and the LCP, in the middle third of the inion-mastoid
              line (RAsV3-VA), we found 90\% of the V3-VA. The measurements
              taken during the second stage revealed that the artery was in the
              middle third of the X line in 97\% of the cases. 85\% of the
              patients presented the total of the V3s-VA on the RAsV3-VA and in
              85\% there was a direct relationship with the V3 segment and the
              RPV3s-VA. CONCLUSION: We propose an easy-to-implement system to
              delimit the risk area of the V3-VA during the PMSOA. We believe
              that these landmarks provide a practical, reliable, costless and
              useful tool that could decrease the risk of lesion of the V3-VA
              during this approach without the need of using.",

              online survey among dementia and PET experts worldwide to
              investigate the anticipated future role of tau-PET in clinical
              practice and trials. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-eight dementia
              experts, comprising 143 clinicians and 121 researchers, covering
              six continents participated. The vast majority (90\%) fostered a
              positive attitude toward the added value of tau-PET in clinical

              prognostication in a cognitively impaired memory clinic

               primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants. METHODS: We
               conducted a meta-analysis with individual participant data from
               1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n
               = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401],
               and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36
               centers, with a measure of amyloid-$\beta$ pathology (CSF [n =
               600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The
               estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA
               variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) $\epsilon$4 status was
               determined using generalized estimating equation models.
               RESULTS: Amyloid-$\beta$ positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA
               (86\%) than in nfvPPA (20\%) or svPPA (16\%; p < 0.001).
               Prevalence of amyloid-$\beta$ positivity increased with age in
               nfvPPA (from 10\% at age 50 years to 27\% at age 80 years, p <
               0.01) and svPPA (from 6\% at age 50 years to 32\% at age 80
               years, p < 0.001), but not in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across PPA
               variants, ApoE $\epsilon$4 carriers were more often
               amyloid-$\beta$ positive (58.0\%) than noncarriers (35.0\%, p <
               0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the
               most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76\%), frontotemporal
               lobar degeneration-TDP-43 in svPPA (80\%), and frontotemporal
               lobar degeneration-TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA (64\%). INTERPRETATION:
               This study shows that the current PPA classification system
               helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts
               and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype
               should be considered when interpreting amyloid-$\beta$
               biomarkers in PPA patients. Ann Neurol 2018;84:737-748.",

               disease and is one of the most common causes of dementia in
               people under 65. There is often a significant diagnostic delay,
               as FTD can be confused with other psychiatric conditions. A lack
               of knowledge regarding FTD by health professionals is one
               possible cause for this diagnostic confusion. OBJECTIVES: The
               aim of this study was to adapt and validate the Frontotemporal
               Dementia Knowledge Scale (FTDKS) in Spanish. METHODS: A
               translation was done, following cross-cultural adaptation
               guidelines, which consisted of forward translation, blind back
               translation, and an analysis by a committee of experts. For the
               present study, 134 professionals from different health areas

               cognitive complaints before infection and to study cognitive
               dysfunction according to disease severity and cognitive risk
               factors. METHODS: Forty-five post-COVID-19 patients and
               forty-five controls underwent extensive neuropsychological
               evaluation, which assessed cognitive domains such as memory,
               language, attention, executive functions, and visuospatial
               skills, including psychiatric symptomatology scales. Data were

               conditions, and functionality for activities of daily living
               before and after COVID-19. RESULTS: Significant differences
               between groups were found in cognitive composites of memory
               (p=0.016, Cohen's d= 0.73), attention (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.2),
               executive functions (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.4), and language
               (p=0.002, Cohen's d=0.87). The change from premorbid to
               post-infection functioning was significantly different between
               severity groups (WHODAS, p=0.037). Self-reported anxiety was

               argue for the inclusion of cognitive assessment as a

               With the easing of lockdown restrictions, the social mobility
               decreased in residential places, slightly increased in
               workplaces and almost return to normal in pharmacies/groceries.
               Variations in ED visits correlate better with social mobility in
               workplaces (coef. =0.75, p < 0.001) than in groceries/pharmacies
               (coef. =0.68, p < 0.001). OC decreased 43\%. Fourteen percent of
               OC were tele consults. This was associated with an increase of
               the geographical area of influence of our center (standard
               distance of 109 km in 2019 and 127 km in 2020). Conclusions:
               Despite an increase in social mobility, the number of ED visits
               and OC to an Argentinian tertiary neurological center remain
               worrisomely low. The pandemic catalyzed the introduction of
               telemedicine in our country. This has also allowed patients from
               distant zones to gain access to specialized neurological care.",

               assessment of tissue damage, allowing evaluation of multiple
               sclerosis (MS) lesion evolution over time--a perspective not
               obtainable with postmortem histopathology. Relapsing-remitting
               experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an
               experimental model of MS that can be induced in the common
               marmoset, a small new world primate, and that causes perivenular
               white matter (WM) lesions similar to those observed in MS.
               METHODS Brain lesion development and evolution were studied in
               vivo and postmortem in four marmosets with EAE through serial
               T2- and T2*-weighted scans at 7-tesla. Supratentorial WM lesions
               were identified and characterized. RESULTS Of 97 lesions
               observed, 86 (88\%) were clearly perivenular, and 62 (72\%)
               developed around veins that were visible even prior to EAE
               induction. The perivenular configuration was confirmed by
               postmortem histopathology. Most affected veins, and their
               related perivascular Virchow-Robin spaces, passed into the
               subarachnoid space rather than the ventricles. CONCLUSION As in
               human MS, the intimate association between small veins and EAE
               lesions in the marmoset can be studied with serial in vivo MRI.
               This further strengthens the usefulness of this model for
               understanding the process of perivenular lesion development and
               accompanying tissue destruction in MS.",

               analysis to identify recurrence predictors in a cohort of 203
               TGA patients from a single center in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
               diagnosed between January 2011 and March 2017 Clinical features
               and complementary studies (laboratory results, jugular vein
               Doppler ultrasound and brain MRI) were analyzed. Comparison
               between patients with recurrent versus single episode TGA was
               performed, applying a multivariate logistic regression model.
               RESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 65 years (20-84); 52\%
               were female. Median time elapsed between symptom onset and ER
               visit was two hours, with the average episode duration lasting
               four hours. Mean follow-up was 22 months. Sixty-six percent of
               patients referred to an identifiable trigger. Jugular reflux was
               present in 66\% of patients; and 22\% showed images with
               hippocampus restriction on diffusion-weighted MRI. Eight percent
               of patients had TGA recurrence. Patients with recurrent TGA had
               a more frequent history of migraine than patients without

               Patients with migraine may have a higher risk of recurrent TGA.
               None of the other clinical characteristics evaluated allowed us
               to predict an increased risk of recurrence. Although the

               following administration of mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna) or adenovirus
               vector (Janssen) vaccines in the U.S.. METHODS: We utilized
               publicly available data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event
               Reporting System (VAERS) collected between January 1, 2021-June
               14, 2021. All free text symptoms that were reported within 42
               days of vaccine administration were manually reviewed and
               grouped into 36 individual neurological diagnostic categories.
               Post-vaccination neurological event rates were compared between
               vaccine types and to age-matched baseline incidence rates in the
               U.S. and rates of neurological events following COVID. RESULTS:
               Of 306,907,697 COVID vaccine doses administered during the study
               timeframe, 314,610 (0.1\%) people reported any adverse event and
               105,214 (0.03\%) reported neurological adverse events in a
               median of 1 day (IQR0-3) from inoculation. Guillain-Barre
               Syndrome (GBS), and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) occurred in
               fewer than 1 per 1,000,000 doses. Significantly more
               neurological adverse events were reported following Janssen
               (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccination compared to either Pfizer-BioNtech
               (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273; 0.15\% versus 0.03\% versus
               0.03\% of doses, respectively,P<0.0001). The
               observed-to-expected ratios for GBS, CVT and seizure following
               Janssen vaccination were $\geq$1.5-fold higher than background
               rates. However, the rate of neurological events after acute

               populations is needed to validate their clinical utility. In
               this work, we assessed the diagnostic performance of
               cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL) in a
               neurocognitive clinical setting. A total of 51 patients with
               different cognitive clinical syndromes and 11 cognitively normal
               individuals were evaluated in a memory clinic in Argentina.
               Clinical conditions included mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n =
               12), dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT, n = 14), behavioral
               variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, n = 13), and primary
               progressive aphasia (logopenic [n = 6], semantic [n = 2], and
               nonfluent [n = 4]). We quantified CSF NfL and core Alzheimer's
               disease biomarkers using commercially available ELISA kits.
               Cortical thickness was analyzed on brain magnetic resonance
               imaging scans from 10 controls and 10 patients. CSF NfL was
               significantly increased in MCI, FTD, and DAT patients compared
               with controls (Kruskal-Wallis, p < .0001). Interestingly,
               receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the
               highest area under the curve (AUC) value when analyzing control
               versus bvFTD patients (AUC = 0.9441). Also, we observed a
               marginally significant correlation between NfL levels and left
               orbitofrontal cortex thickness in a small group of patients with
               FTD. Overall, our results further support CSF NfL as a promising
               biomarker in the diagnostic workup of bvFTD.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the
               differences in early (EOAD) and late (LOAD) onset of Alzheimer´s
               disease, as well as glucose uptake, regional cerebral blood flow
               (R1), amyloid depositions, and functional brain connectivity
               between normal young (YC) and Old Controls (OC). METHODOLOGY:
               The study included 22 YC (37 $\pm$ 5 y), 22 OC (73 $\pm$ 5.9 y),
               18 patients with EOAD (63 $\pm$ 9.5 y), and 18 with LOAD (70.6
               $\pm$ 7.1 y). Patients underwent FDG and PIB PET/CT. R1 images
               were obtained from the compartmental analysis of the dynamic PIB
               acquisitions. Images were analyzed by a voxel-wise and a
               VOI-based approach. Functional connectivity was studied from the
               R1 and glucose uptake images. RESULTS: OC had a significant
               reduction of R1 and glucose uptake compared to YC, predominantly
               at the dorsolateral and mesial frontal cortex. EOAD and LOAD vs.
               OC showed a decreased R1 and glucose uptake at the posterior
               parietal cortex, precuneus, and posterior cingulum. EOAD vs.
               LOAD showed a reduction in glucose uptake and R1 at the
               occipital and parietal cortex and an increased at the mesial
               frontal and temporal cortex. There was a mild increase in an
               amyloid deposition at the frontal cortex in LOAD vs. EOAD. YC
               presented higher connectivity than OC in R1 but lower
               connectivity considering glucose uptake. Moreover, EOAD and LOAD
               showed a decreased connectivity compared to controls that were
               more pronounced in glucose uptake than R1. CONCLUSION: Our
               results demonstrated differences in amyloid deposition and
               functional imaging between groups and a differential pattern of
               functional connectivity in R1 and glucose uptake in each
               clinical condition. These findings provide new insights into the
               pathophysiological processes of AD and may have an impact on
               patient diagnostic evaluation.",

               still, evidence for the modulation of sleep timing by lunar
               phases is controversial. Here, we use wrist actimetry to show a
               clear synchronization of nocturnal sleep timing with the lunar
               cycle in participants living in environments that range from a
               rural setting with and without access to electricity in
               indigenous Toba/Qom communities in Argentina to a highly
               urbanized postindustrial setting in the United States. Our
               results show that sleep starts later and is shorter on the
               nights before the full moon when moonlight is available during
               the hours following dusk. Our data suggest that moonlight likely
               stimulated nocturnal activity and inhibited sleep in
               preindustrial communities and that access to artificial light
               may emulate the ancestral effect of early-night moonlight.",
